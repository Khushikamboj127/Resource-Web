            <h2>Understanding White Balance in Photography</h2>
            <p>When the white balance is correct in a digital photograph, white will appear white and all colors in the photo will look as they do naturally. If the white balance is not set correctly, your photos will have an unusual color cast across them. A white object will not look white.</p>

            <h2>What is <span>White Balance</span>?</h2>
            <p>White balance is a setting in your camera that helps you produce a natural-looking coloration in your image. The goal of white balance is to achieve the most accurate colors possible. The color of your subject in a photograph is affected by the type of lighting you’re using. Our eyes and our brain automatically compensate for the differences in light. For example, a green object will always appear green to the naked eye regardless of whether it’s viewed in sunlight, fluorescent, or incandescent light.</p>
            <p>The white balance setting on your digital camera controls the color temperature of the light by filtering it. This is done so that any white object will look white, and all the colors in your image will look natural and as they should do.

              Digital cameras use white balance to compensate for the difference between what our eyes see and what the cameras record. The white balance setting helps to match the color cast of the main light source illuminating your subject.</p>

            <h2>How to <span>Determine</span> and <span>Adjust</span> White Balance Settings?</h2>
              <p>The first step in determining your white balance is to find where you can change and adjust it on your camera. In most camera, you will be able to find this in your MENU option, where you will find the various white balance settings. If you have never touched this, then it will read AWB, which stands for auto white balance. </p>
              <p>Using the auto white balance on your digital camera will work very well in most ambient light situations. The main catch comes when there is a mixed lighting condition. This can be from artificial lighting or natural light.</p>
              <p>Using the auto setting for white balance, you don’t have to worry about whether you are taking photos in:</p>
              <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Direct sunlight</li>
                <li>With an overcast sky</li>
                <li>Under a tungsten bulb or an incandescent bulbs</li>
                <li>With mixed lighting conditions</li>
                <li>Under artificial lighting that has a blue cast or a green tint</li>
                <li>With flash or studio strobe lighting</li>
              </ul>
              <p>White balancing can be done by using presets. You can preset the white balance in the camera’s menu system, where you will find a number of different options to help you achieve the perfect white balance. This will help you avoid any unwanted color casts.

                White balancing using these settings is easier than using custom white balance settings based on manual control of the Kelvin temperatures.</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>Auto White Balance Setting</li>
                <p>The auto white balance auto-adjusts based on the ambient light the digital camera sees. It automatically adjusts for natural-looking colors. Auto white balance is best used with ambient lighting. Once you start to add flash or strobes, the automatic white balance may not provide the correct results.</p>
                <li>Daylight</li>
                <p>For outdoor scenes under clear skies in direct sunlight, the color temperature is around 5,200K.</p>
                <li>Shade</li>
                <p>Used for photos you take in the shade when you are outdoors. The color temperature in the open shade outdoors is about 7000K.</p>
                <li>Cloudy</li>
                <p>This is for cloudy days and when you have an overcast sky. The light will have quite a cold color temperature of about 6000K.</p>
                <li>Tungsten Light</li>
                <p>For indoor scenes under old-style incandescent (tungsten), light or more modern warm LED or fluorescent lights with a color temperature of approx. 3200K. As with the fluorescent white balance setting, you need to be careful with the type of light you are photographing in.</p>
                <li>White Fluorescent Light</li>
                <p>Fluorescent bulbs and tubes come in primarily three different color temperatures. These are cool white, warm white, and daylight. The fluorescent lights’ white balance in digital cameras generally filters out the cool white color cast.</p>
                <li>Flash</li>
                <p>Used with flash photography. Flash outputs a very clean light that does not require any color filtration of white balance in digital photography. The one catch with white balance and flash or strobe light is that auto white balance may not detect these lights. If they are dedicated to the camera, then there should be communication between the light and the camera. Then the camera will know the appropriate white balance required and should have no problem auto-setting the white balance.</p>
                <li>Custom</li>
                <p>You adjust the settings manually. This involves dialing in the correct amount of filtration to achieve the desired white balance setting. The Kelvin scale is used to help determine this.

                  Kelvin is a scale of the measurement of color temperature. It is used to help set the white balance on your digital camera manually by assigning a Kelvin number to warm, cool, and neutral color temperatures.</p>
                  <li>Color Temperature</li>
                  <p>The ability to make your image warmer or cooler by adjusting this setting. You can use these settings to adjust based on the camera’s suggestions. These are helpful to use if you have never experimented or changed your white balance prior to shooting.

                    For RAW images, you can adjust the white balance in programs such as Lightroom during post production. But, changing the white balance before shooting will help you determine what you want your image to look like.</p>
