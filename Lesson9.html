            <h2>Common Beginner Photography Mistakes</h2>
            <p>As a new photographer, it’s inevitable that you’re going to make mistakes. Some of the most common photography mistakes beginners make are also the easiest to fix. When you first start taking photos, your images may be:</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>Underexposed</li>
                <li>Overexposed</li>
                <li>Out of focus</li>
                <li>Poorly composed</li>
                <li>Or just plain old dull and boring</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Don’t let it get you down or stress you out because it’s all part of the process you need to go through to learn photography. With digital photography, you can take as many images as you need and make as many mistakes as necessary to perfect your craft.</p>

            <h2>Not Knowing the <span>Settings</span> on Your Camera</h2>
            <p>Chances are you’ve spent hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a new camera. You may be surprised to see the user manual is a difficult-to-understand, black and white book that you can’t read without a magnifying glass.</p>
            <p>Before you take another photo, READ THE MANUAL from reading the user manual from front to back!!! And when you’re done, read it again!</p>
            <p>While you’re going through the manual, be sure to learn how to change these key settings on your camera;</p>
            <ul class="bullets">
              <li>Shutter Speed</li>
              <li>Aperture</li>
              <li>ISO Sensitivity (you may have manual, presets, and automatic options)</li>
              <li>White Balance (auto, preset, manual)</li>
              <li>File Type (JPEG & RAW)</li>
              <li>Exposure Compensation</li>
              <li>Internal Camera Menu (learn how to navigate)</li>
              <li>Flash (learn to turn the built in flash on and off)</li>
              <li>Focusing – Automatic Focus (AF) and Manual Focus (MF)</li>
              <li>Focusing Modes (Single-servo AF, Continuous-servo AF)</li>
              <li>Drive (or Burst) Modes (Single, Low Continuous, High Continuous)</li>
              <li>Format the memory card (it erases your images, so learn to back up your photos)</li>
              <li>Self Timer</li>

            <h2>Not Learning the Basic Photographic <span>Terms and Concepts</span></h2>
            <p>You must learn to crawl before you can walk and photography isn’t very different. One of the most common mistakes beginner photographers make is not learning the basics. You have to learn the basics so you have a solid foundation to build upon. You can go from zero to Ansel Adams overnight. Great photos are made with a combination of skill and creativity.</p>
            <p>So, take some time to learn about light, the different types of light, and the significant role light has in creating an image. Learn all about ISO and how changing ISO affects exposure. Get to know the shutter controls and how to stop action or show motion blur. Learn how ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed are the foundation of photographic exposure.</p>

            <h2> Being Too Afraid to Try <span>Something New</span></h2>
            <p>It’s human nature to fear the unknown. Mastering a new skill can be a frightening experience. You may get overwhelmed as we introduce you to all this complicated photography stuff. Just remember one thing – your camera won’t bite, we promise. It won’t talk back, it won’t break (unless you drop it). So, take a deep breath and jump in with both feet.</p>
            <p>Humans are creatures of habit, and it’s no exception when it comes to photography. We find a lot of new photographers learn a few basic settings. Then they stop learning new techniques as soon as their pictures start turning fairly decent. Complacency can make a potentially great photographer an average one.

              Our response is to overcome your fears and be a BADASS! Aim high and set your sights on learning one new skill a week. Get outside your comfort zone, turn off all those automatic settings, and try something new. Don’t worry about making photography mistakes.</p>

              <h2>Staying in <span>Automatic Mode</span></h2>
              <p>There are automatic settings for nearly everything on your camera (Exposure, ISO, White Balance, Focus, etc.). Automatic settings can make your life easier because they help you take okay photos. The downside to using automatic settings is they can become a crutch. They will hold you back from developing your photography skills and style. It’s like keeping training wheels on a bicycle; at some point, you have to take them off.</p>
              <p>If you’re apprehensive about turning off automatic settings, we recommend taking it one step at a time. Going from fully automatic to manual may be too much, too soon. You may want to start with automatic focus. Or, try setting your ISO manually. Once you have grown accustomed to using one manual setting, move on to the next.</p>

              <h2>Being a <span>Fair Weather</span> Photographer</h2>
              <p>Everyone loves a day in the great outdoors with warm dry weather and bright sunshine. And you may think sunny days are ideal for photography. But as you become a more experienced and creative photographer, you will soon learn poor weather can be the best time to take photographs. As a matter of fact, photographing in direct sunlight is less than ideal because you have to cope with the harsh sunlight and dark shadows.</p>
              <p>Try taking some shots on a cloudy or partially cloudy day. If you’re an early riser, photograph the sunrise, or capture a sunset at the end of the day. Don’t be afraid to head out into the snow or on a rainy day. Take some time to learn about the light and how it impacts your photos. As you start to explore light you will soon learn how soft light is more flattering than direct sunlight.</p>

              <h2>Not Using a Tripod</h2>
              <p>Certain situations call for the use of a tripod. Generally speaking, a shutter speed at or below Certain situations call for the use of a tripod. Generally speaking, a shutter speed at or below 1/60th second requires the use of a tripod. A longer lens focal length and a longer exposure will increase the probability of camera shake. This will result in blurred images. You need a tripod if your shutter speed is longer than the reciprocal of your focal length. For example, if you’re using a 50mm lens and your speed is 1/50th or below, you should use a tripod.</p>

              <p>Tripods are a “must-have” in your photography bag of tricks. Using a tripod will make a difference in your photography because it slows the photo-making process. Since you’re taking the time to set up a tripod, you’ll be more conscious of the image you’re taking. When you slow the image-making process down, you will make better decisions regarding composition and exposure. This results in better-quality photos and fewer digital photography mistakes. So use a tripod whenever you can.</p>

              <h2>Not Changing <span>Camera Settings</span></h2>
              <p>If you rely on automatic settings, then you probably don’t change your settings unless your photos are not turning out. If you’re changing locations, the weather changes, or you’re taking photos at different times of the day, you may need to change your settings.</p>

              <h2>Only Shooting at <span>Eye Level</span></h2>
              <p>It’s human nature to photograph standing up with the camera at eye level. It is, after all, how we see the world when we’re not sitting or lying down. Photographing at eye level can seem natural and ordinary, but it can make your photos boring and uninteresting. Changing your perspective can have a huge impact on your images.</p>
              <p>Try raising the camera above your head or taking photos of your subject from over 10 feet. Or, crouch down close to the ground and capture pictures from a low angle. Taking photos from different perspectives can have a profound impact on your images. Number eight on our list of beginner photography mistakes is photographing from different angles.</p>

              <h2>Out of <span>Focus</span> Images</h2>
              <p>Taking images that are out of focus is a common photography mistake. Images end up blurred because of camera shake, failure to focus on the right spot, or using a shutter that is too slow to freeze the action. If your images are not consistently sharp, you may have an issue with focus.

                A key skill every photographer must master is taking photos that are in focus. Learn how to use the auto-focus settings on your camera. Choosing to use single point auto-focus, rather than multi-point, will help you take sharper photos. Practice manually focusing too.</p>

              <h2>Expecting an <span>Expensive</span> Camera to Make You a <span>Better</span> Photographer</h2>
              <p>For new and experienced photographers, getting a new camera is fun and exciting. A new camera can motivate you to get out and test drive new features. It can also help you be more creative. A larger sensor will produce better quality images, but it won’t make you a better photographer.

                Regardless of the camera you’re using, you still need to wean yourself off all those automatic settings. Learn to master the basics of exposure and composition.</p>
                <p>Before going out and buying expensive gear, first work on advancing your knowledge of photography. Learn how to fully utilize the features of the camera you have before buying new gear.</p>

              <h2>Don’t Be Over Reliant on <span>Post Processing</span></h2>
              <p>Make sure you get as much as you can right when you are taking your photographs. Don’t be lazy and think you can fix mistakes you make later when you’re sitting at your computer.</p>
              <p>Digital photography is easier because you have a lot more flexibility to manipulate photos. Sure, modern software allows you to make changes to so many aspects of photos and cover up photography mistakes. But it’s still better to have a well exposed and sharp image to start with.</p>

            <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
            <p>When you’re starting out in photography, sometimes it’s difficult to know where to begin. Photography mistakes can be corrected by learning the fundamentals. Study how to use the settings on your camera. This will help you gain confidence.</p>
            <p>Get comfortable using your camera. Then you can move on to experiment with composition techniques like the rule of thirds and others. But first, concentrate on the essential camera controls.</p>
            <p>Focus on mastering one skill at a time. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Be fearless and most of all, HAVE FUN!!</p>
